  :subcategory: 
  :features:
    Class: Second-generation (‘atypical’) antipsychotic drug
    Actions: Antipsychotic. Effective against +ve and -ve symptoms
    MOA: Modification of dopaminergic transmission in the mesolimbic/mesocortical
      pathways. Aripiprazole binds strongly to dopamine D2 receptors but has partial
      agonist activity which may explain its low incidence of EPS. 5HT 2A antagonism
      is probably important.
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Oral admin. Long (75h) half-life
    Clinical use: Schizophrenia and other psychotic states. Manic phase of bipolar
      disorder
    Adverse effects: Fewer side effects than many other antipsychotics (e.g. minor

  :name: Articaine
  :category: Local anaesthetics
  :subcategory: 
  :features:
    Actions: Prevents the propagation of nerve action potentials. Blocks small-diameter
      pain fibres at lower concentration than large fibres.
    MOA: Use-dependent block of voltage-gated Na+ channels from inside of cell membrane.
      Penetrates cell membrane in its lipid-soluble, uncharged form. (See fig.) Less
      active in inflamed tissue, where the lower pH increases ionisation of the weakly
      basic local anaesthetic (LA).
    Clinical use: Articaine, usually combined with epinephrine, is the favoured LA
      for dentistry in many countries
    Adverse effects: Low toxicity due to rapid breakdown in blood. Potential paresthesia
      if used for mandibular nerve block.
aspirin [inflammation and anti-inflammatory drugs]:
  :card_id: '3.02'
  :name: Aspirin

    Class: A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
    Actions: Reduces inflammation, is analgesic for inflammatory pain, is antipyretic
      (i.e. reduces raised temperature). Inhibits platelet aggregation (see card 10.01).
    MOA: Irreversible acetylation of cyclo-oxygenases; weakly COX-1 selective Given
      orally. Half-life only 30min – rapid hydrolysis to salicylate but effects last
      longer because the COX has been inactivated and new enzyme must be produced.
    Clinical use: 'Main use: as antithrombotic in myocardial infarction (see card
      set 7). Other NSAIDs are preferred for anti-inflammatory action and analgesia
      in musculo-skeletal conditions.'
    Adverse effects: Gastrointestinal disturbances, especially gastric bleeding. In
      high dosage can cause ‘salicylism’ (tinnitus, vertigo, reduced hearing); allergic
      reactions occasionally; renal toxicity rarely. Can cause the potentially fatal
      Reye’s syndrome (encephalopathy  liver disorder) in children after a viral infection.
    Special points: Should not be used in children. Can cause increased effect of
      warfarin resulting in bleeding Should not be used for gout because it reduces
      urate excretion  interferes with the action of uricosuric agents.
aspirin [thrombosis]:

echothiophate (dyflos, sarin) [cholinergic pharmacology]:
  :card_id: '1.09'
  :name: Echothiophate
  :category: Cholinergic pharmacology
  :subcategory: 
  :features:
    Class: Irreversible (organophosphate) anticholinesterase
    Similar drug(s): dyflos, sarin
    Actions: Parasympathomimetic – increased peristalsis, increased secretions, bradycardia,
      bronchoconstriction, decreased intraocular pressure. At the neuromuscular junction
      – fasciculation and increased twitch tension. With nerve gases (e.g. sarin)
      persistent potentiation of ACh action leads to paralysis and death.
    MOA: Irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase potentiates actions of released
      ACh at cholinergic nerve-endings. Binds to enzyme’s esteratic site causing irreversible
      phosphorylation. (Pralidoxime, a cholinesterase reactivator, can reverse the
      phosphorylation.) Most are readily absorbed through the skin, gut and lungs.
      (Protective clothing needed to avoid absorption of insecticides and nerve gases.)
      Long-acting.
    Clinical use: Glaucoma

    Actions: At the neuromuscular junction – fasciculation and increased twitch tension.
      Parasympathomimetic – increased peristalsis, increased secretions, bradycardia,
      bronchoconstriction.
    MOA: Reversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase reduces the breakdown of ACh
      at cholinergic nerve- endings, so potentiating neurotransmission. Edrophonium
      binds only to the anionic site in the esterase. The binding is mainly electrostatic
      and reverses readily. Given i.v. or i.m. Short duration of action (10min).
    Clinical use: Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. To confirm that a proper dose of
      neostigmine or pyridostigmine is being used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis.
      Action too short for therapeutiic use.
    Adverse effects: May exacerbate asthma. Unwanted parasympathomimetic actions can

  :category: Affective disorders
  :subcategory: Major Depressive Disorder
  :features:
    Class: 'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (Similar drugs: paroxetine,
      citalopram, escitalopram,'
    Actions: Antidepressant
    MOA: Inhibits the reuptake 5-HT into serotonergic neurons, so potentiating transmitter
      action. The antidepressant action is not seen for a few weeks, because longer-term
      changes (e.g. down- regulation of receptors) are required for this. (Less marked
      antimuscarinic and antihistaminergic actions than the TCAs.)
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: 'Oral administration. Brain concentration rises over a few days.
      Hepatic P450 metabolism followed by conjugation reactions. T0.5 1–3 days. Longer-lasting
      active metabolite. (Half-lives of other SSRIs: paroxetine, 18–24h, fluvoxamine,
      18–24h, escitalopram, 24–36h, sertraline, 24–36h.) Strongly bound.'
    Clinical use: Widely prescribed. Depression. Obsessive–compulsive disorder. Panic
      disorder. Bulimia nervosa
    Adverse effects: Anxiety and insomnia; can cause nausea, diarrhoea and headache.
      Sexual dysfunction. Increased risk of suicide in young patients. Not prescribed
      with MAOIs (risk of serotonin syndrome). Hyponatraemia in elderly. Overdose
      toxicity much less than for TCAs.
    Special points: Escitalopram is the active enantiomer of citalopram. Sertraline
      and escitalopram are the SSRIs which are most selective for 5-HT uptake inhibition.

      To treat toxicity caused by methotrexate (a folate antagonist).
    Adverse effects: Rare; occasionally GIT disturbances
    Special points: Should not be used in undiagnosed megaloblastic anaemias because
      if the anaemia is due to Vit B12 - deficiency the anemia may improve but the
      neurological lesions will persist and could get worse.

      system). Involuntary muscle movement. Hallucinations, delerium and dysphoria
      during recovery. Respiratory depression in overdose.
lamotrigine [antiepileptic drugs]:
  :card_id: '25.07'
  :name: Lamotrigine
  :category: Antiepileptic drugs
  :subcategory: 
  :features:
    Class: Antiepileptic
    Actions: Anticonvulsant. Reduces frequency of mood episodes in bipolar disorder
    MOA: Inhibition of glutamate release decreases postsynaptic neuronal excitation.
      This may be due to Na+ (and perhaps Ca2+ ) channel inhibition in the nerve ending.
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Oral admin. Subject to hepatic glucuronidation. T0.5 24–36h

    Class: A disease-modifying antirheumatoid drug (DMARD)
    Actions: Modifies the immune reaction underlying rheumatoid arthritis through
      an inhibitory action on activated T cells.
    MOA: Gives rise to a metabolite that inhibits dihydrooratate dehydrogenase; this
      results in inhibition of T-cell proliferation and decreased production of autoantibodies
      by B cells. Absorbed orally. The metabolite undergoes enterohepatic cycling,
      half-life thus ~18 days.
    Clinical use: Rheumatoid arthritis. Particularly effective in combination with
      methotrexate
    Adverse effects: "~25% of patients get diarrhoea. Increased BP, weight gain can
      occur. The long half-life can lead to cumulative toxicity."

  :name: Levetiracetam
  :category: Antiepileptic drugs
  :subcategory: 
  :features:
    Class: Antiepileptic
    Actions: Anticonvulsant
    MOA: Activity is thought to be due to binding to synaptic vesicle protein SV2A
      – how this modifies the release of neurotransmitter (e.g. glutamate) is not
      established.
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Oral admin. Mostly excreted unchanged. T0.5 7h
    Clinical use: As an adjunct to other anticonvulsants in the treatment of partial
      seizures
    Adverse effects: Sedation, dizziness, paraesthesia. Few drug interactions
levodopa (l-dopa) – carbidopa [neurodegenerative disorders]:
  :card_id: '20.01'
  :name: Levodopa (L-dopa) – carbidopa
  :category: Neurodegenerative disorders
  :subcategory: Parkinson’s
  :features:
    Class: Levodopa – precursor of dopamine
    Actions: Antiparkinsonian
    MOA: Decarboxylation of levodopa to dopamine restores some activity in nigrostriatal
      pathway. Carbidopa inhibits levodopa decarboxylation outside the brain, allowing
      the use of smaller doses and reducing peripheral side effects of dopamine (e.g.
      postural hypotension).
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Oral admin. Levodopa T0.5 1–2h when co-administered with carbidopa
    Clinical use: Cornerstone of therapy in Parkinson’s disease. Levodopa is usually
      given with a peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor. More effective against
      akinesia and rigidity than against tremor. Effectiveness diminishes over some
      months to a few years.
    Adverse effects: 'Anorexia, nausea and vomiting. Postural hypotension. Acute schizophrenia-like
      syndrome. Confusion, anxiety, disorientation and insomnia or nightmares. More
      slowly developing effects: dyskinesia (in most patients after 2 years) and ''on-off''
      effects (rapid fluctuations between dyskinesia and hypokinesia/rigidity).'
levothyroxine (liothyronine (t3)) [thyroid and antithyroid drugs]:
  :card_id: '17.02'
  :name: Levothyroxine

    Class: Synthetic T4
    Similar drug(s): liothyronine (T3)
    Actions: Increased metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats; increase in
      basal metabolic rate
    MOA: The drug enters cells and is converted to T 3 which enters the nucleus and
      binds to a thyroid hormone receptor. The complex activates transcription resulting
      in the generation of mRNA and the synthesis of proteins  enzymes responsible
      for the metabolic actions of T 4 . Given orally. Has long half-life.
    Clinical use: Hypothyroidism. Liothyronine is used for myxoedema coma
    Adverse effects: Nervousness, palpitations, insomnia, heat intolerance, weight
      loss
    Special points: Best given on an empty stomach since some foods can interfere
      with absorption
lidocaine (lignocaine) [local anaesthetics]:
  :card_id: '28.01'
  :name: Lidocaine (Lignocaine)
  :category: Local anaesthetics
  :subcategory: 
  :features:
    Class: 'Local anaesthetic (similar drug: mepivacaine)'
    Actions: Prevents the propagation of nerve action potentials. Blocks small-diameter
      pain fibres at lower concentration than large fibres.
    MOA: Use-dependent block of voltage-gated Na+ channels from inside of cell membrane.
      Penetrates cell membrane in its lipid-soluble, uncharged form. (See fig.) Less
      active in inflamed tissue, where the lower pH increases ionisation of the weakly
      basic local anaesthetic (LA).
    Clinical use: Surface and infiltration anaesthesia, nerve block (e.g. dentistry)
      and epidural and spinal anaesthesia (sometimes combined with an opioid). Adrenaline
      may be added to reduce loss to blood stream. EMLA (eutectic mixture of LA) is
      a widely used topical combination of lidocaine with prilocaine. Ventricular
      dysrhythmia (see card 5.02).
    Adverse effects: Few adverse effects. High plasma concentration may cause seizures
      and cardiac depression Transient neurologic symptoms are more prevalent with
      lidocaine than bupivacaine following epidural use.
lidocaine (mexiletine, tocainide) [antidysrhythmic drugs]:
  :card_id: '5.02'
  :name: Lidocaine
  :category: Antidysrhythmic drugs
  :subcategory: 
  :features:
    Class: Class 1b antidysrhythmic
    Similar drug(s): mexiletine, tocainide
    Actions: Antidysrhythmic, local anaesthetic (see card 28.01)
    MOA: Belongs to class 1b of the Vaughan Williams classification. Blocks open and
      inactivated Na+ channels in the cell membrane (shows ‘use-dependence’, so more
      likely to act in damaged, depolarised tissue). Na + channel block reduces the
      rate of phase 0 depolarisation, increasing the effective refractory period and
      slowing AV conduction.
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Given i.v. (Very high first-pass metabolism precludes oral admin.)
      Short T0.5 – 2h. Subject to cytochrome P450 metabolism. Mexiletine and tocainide
      are orally active.
    Clinical use: Treatment and prevention of ventricular fibrillation especially
      following infarction. Also digoxin- induced dysrhythmias.
    Adverse effects: Unwanted CNS effects include drowsiness, tremors and convulsions
lithium [affective disorders]:
  :card_id: '24.08'
  :name: Lithium
  :category: Affective disorders
  :subcategory: Bipolar Disorder
  :features:
    Class: A group 1 metallic element
    Actions: Mood ‘stabiliser’
    MOA: Not well established. Being a group 1 element like Na+ and K +, one proposal
      is that Li+ interferes with membrane ion transport, perhaps including neurotransmitter
      reuptake. Actions on phosphatidyl inositol metabolism and on glycogen synthase
      kinase are other possible mechanisms.
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Oral admin. Uptake of lithium into cells leads to accumulation
      in the body over a period of 2 weeks
    Clinical use: Bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder, mania and as adjunct to other
      agents in unipolar depression Clinical effect develops over 3–4 weeks.
    Adverse effects: Diarrhoea, tremor, confusion. Renal toxicity, including nephrogenic
      diabetes insipidus – dehydration Depresses thyroid function. Overdose results
      in convulsions, coma and death. Many drug interactions (e.g. with diuretics).
    Special points: 'Because of a low therapeutic index, it is essential to measure
      the serum Li+ concentration to ensure an effective therapeutic concentration
      with minimal toxicity. Other treatments: antipsychotics (olanzapine) and some
      antiepileptics (lamotrigine, valproate).'
loperamide (diphenoxylate, codeine) [git drugs]:
  :card_id: '14.18'
  :name: Loperamide
  :category: GIT drugs
  :subcategory: Control of motility
  :features:
    Class: Antidiarrhoeal agent
    Similar drug(s): diphenoxylate, codeine
    Actions: Reduces gut motility and secretions. The slower transit time allows for
      more fluid absorption and more solid stools.
    MOA: Agonist action at μ opioid receptors in myenteric plexus of gut inhibits
      peristalsis. Effects can be reversed by naloxone. Loperamide and diphenoxylate,
      but not codeine, achieve low concentrations in CNS, so have few central effects
      (including analgesia and addiction).
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Oral administration. Metabolised by hepatic cytochrome P450
      system. t1⁄2 10h. Diphenoxylate is hydrolysed to an active metabolite.
    Clinical use: Acute diarrhoea. Chronic diarrhoea associated with inflammatory
      bowel disease. Diphenoxylate is commonly administered in a combined preparation
      with atropine.

      absorption
    Clinical use: Chronic constipation. Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation
    Adverse effects: Nausea. Diarrhoea
lysergic acid diethylamide (lsd) (mescaline, dimethyltryptamine (dmt)) [cns stimulants and psychotomimetics]:
  :card_id: '27.03'
  :name: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)
  :category: CNS stimulants and psychotomimetics
  :subcategory: 
  :features:
    Class: Psychotomimetic (hallucinogen)
    Similar drug(s): mescaline, dimethyltryptamine (DMT)
    Actions: Mood alteration, perceptual changes (psychedelic effects), cognitive
      impairment. Paranoid delusions (‘bad trips’ ). Hallucinations at higher doses.
    MOA: Agonist at several 5-HT receptors but psychotomimetic action is attributed
      to 5-HT2A receptors enhancing glutamatergic transmission in cerebral cortex.
      Additional actions may be inhibition of 5-HT release in the Raphe nucei by 5-HT1A
      receptors and modulation of dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway.
      Mescaline acts partly by inhibiting MA reuptake.
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Effective orally. LSD T0.5 3h. DMT has a low oral bioavailability
      so may be smoked
    Clinical use: No clinical use. Important only as a drug of abuse
    Adverse effects: Some sympathomimetic actions (e.g. pupil dilatation, tachycardia).
      Unlike other drugs of abuse they produce little dependence or withdrawal effects.
      LSD is non-fatal in overdose.
magnesium sulfate (lactulose, macrogols) [git drugs]:
  :card_id: '14.13'
  :name: Magnesium sulfate
  :category: GIT drugs
  :subcategory: Control of motility
  :features:
    Class: Osmotic laxative
    Similar drug(s): lactulose, macrogols
    Actions: Purgative
    MOA: These agents are poorly absorbed and raise the osmotic load within the gut
      lumen. This causes ingested water to be retained and water also to be withdrawn
      from the blood stream. The increased fluid volume promotes movement along the
      gut. Purgation occurs within 2h.
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Taken orally. Not absorbed
    Clinical use: Bowel cleansing prior to surgery or examination (MgSO4). Constipation
      (macrogols and lactulose) The effects of lactulose develop after 2–3 days.

  :features:
    Actions: Antidysrhythmic. Osmotic purgative
    MOA: Slows AV node conduction. Reduces increased cardiac excitability due to hypomagnesaemia,
      which is common after heart operations. The cellular mechanism of action is
      not established but is likely to involve effects on membrane ion permeability
      or transport.
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Given i.v
    Clinical use: Prevention of supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular arrhythmias
      after bypass surgery Ventricular dysrhythmias due to digoxin toxicity. Management
      of torsades de pointes.

  :card_id: '31.03'
  :name: Mefloquine
  :category: Antiprotozoal drugs
  :subcategory: Malaria
  :features:
    Class: An antimalarial drug
    Actions: A schizonticidal drug that kills malarial parasites in red blood cells
    MOA: It is thought to inhibit haem polymerase which would normally degrade haem,
      rendering it harmless to the parasite. The toxic haem molecules accumulate and
      kill the parasite. Given orally, onset of action is slow, T0.5 16h.
    Clinical use: For chemoprophylaxis of falciparum malaria in areas where it is
      chloroquine resistant
    Adverse effects: GIT disturbances, neuropsychiatric reactions (e.g. ataxia, confusion,
      hallucinations, convulsions), CVS disorders, rash, fever, leucopenia.
    Special points: Not used for treatment of falciparum malaria because of resistance;
      not used for the benign malarias because less toxic drugs are available.

    Actions: CNS depression, unconsciousness (in combination with other anaesthetics).
      Analgesia. Euphoria
    MOA: Reduces opening of NMDA receptor channels. Increases opening of TREK-1 potassium
      channels. (No action on GABAA receptors.) Analgesic action inhibited by opioid
      antagonists, suggesting release of endogenous opioids.
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Administered by inhalation. Low blood/gas partition coefficient
      results in rapid onset and offset of action. Eliminated unchanged via lungs.
      No metabolism.
    Clinical use: General anaesthesia. Because of low potency will not produce full
      surgical anaesthesia by itself; must be combined with more potent agents. In
      subanaesthetic doses used as analgesic for childbirth and emergency pain relief
      (e.g. by paramedics).
    Adverse effects: Few side effects. Oxygen may be required during recovery due
      to possibility of ‘diffusion anoxia’
omalizumab [asthma and antiasthma drugs]:
  :card_id: '12.07'

omeprazole (lansoprazole) [git drugs]:
  :card_id: '14.02'
  :name: Omeprazole
  :category: GIT drugs
  :subcategory: Gastric Ulcer
  :features:
    Class: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
    Similar drug(s): lansoprazole
    Actions: Inhibition of gastric acid secretion
    MOA: Binds irreversibly to the H+ /K+ -ATPase (proton pump) in the gastric parietal
      cells to inhibit H+ transport. Omeprazole (like other PPIs) is a prodrug. The
      acidic conditions in the parietal cell canaliculi convert the drug to the active
      form.
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Mainly eliminated by rapid P450 metabolism in liver (T0.5 ,1–2h),
      but duration of action is long (2–3days) because of covalent binding. The production
      of new PP molecules determines the rate of recovery. Needs enteric coating to
      prevent action of acid before absorption.
    Clinical use: Duodenal and peptic ulcer. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Zollinger-Ellison
      syndrome. As part of the triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori-dependent ulcers.
      Treatment of NSAID-associated ulcers. PPIs are more effective than H2 antagonists.
    Adverse effects: Generally very safe. Occasionally, headache, abdominal pain,
      diarrhoea, flatulence and nausea Long-term use can cause hypergastrinaemia which
      may increase risk of gastric carcinoid tumours.

  :subcategory: 
  :features:
    Class: 'Nicotinic receptor antagonist / non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker
      (Similar drugs:'
    Actions: Paralysis of skeletal muscle
    MOA: Reversible competitive antagonism at muscle-type nicotinic receptors. Inhibits
      binding of ACh to the receptors at the muscle end-plate. End-plate potential
      fails to reach threshold for initiation and propagation of the action potential
      along the muscle fibre. Action reversed by anticholinesterases (e.g. neostigmine
      1.07). Given i.v. Half-life 2–3h. Substantial renal excretion (duration increased
      in renal failure).
    Clinical use: In general anaesthesia – aids tracheal intubation, provides muscle
      relaxation for general surgery and aids mechanical ventilation.
    Adverse effects: Tachycardia (muscarinic antagonist action)
    Special points: Tubocurarine is the archetypal non-depolarizing neuromuscular
      blocker, but it has more side effects, such as bronchoconstriction due to histamine
      release, and is now rarely used.

    Clinical use: Mild to moderate pain, especially headache. It is the most commonly
      used NSAID
    Adverse effects: Few and uncommon with therapeutic doses. Toxic doses cause firstly
      nausea and vomiting and then 24h later potentially fatal liver toxicity.
pethidine (meperidine) (fentanyl, remifentanil, sufentanil) [analgesic drugs and the control of pain]:
  :card_id: '26.02'
  :name: Pethidine (Meperidine)
  :category: Analgesic drugs and the control of pain

    Class: Opioid receptor agonist
    Similar drug(s): fentanyl, remifentanil, sufentanil
    Actions: Analgesia. Euphoria. Physical/psychological dependence. Respiratory depression.
      Inhibition of gut motility. (Antimuscarinic effects of pethidine cause tachycardia.)
    MOA: Activates μ opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord to inhibit pain
      transmission. Activation of κ receptors may exert an additional effect on pain
      transmission in the spinal cord. May inhibit activation of the sensory nerve
      endings. (See also ‘Morphine’ – card 26.01). Oral/ i.m. admin. Subject to hydrolysis
      and P450 oxidation – T0.5 3–5h. Fentanyl is also available as a patch for transdermal
      admin. for long-term effects. Remifentanil has a very short half-life (0.1h).
    Clinical use: Moderate to severe pain. Does not reduce uterine contractions so
      favoured for labour pain Remifentanil and sufentanil are given i.v. for surgical
      analgesia.
    Adverse effects: Constipation (less than morphine), nausea, vomiting, drowsiness,
      dizziness. Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal effects. Larger doses – coma
      with respiratory depression.
phencyclidine (ketamine) [cns stimulants and psychotomimetics]:
  :card_id: '27.04'
  :name: Phencyclidine
  :category: CNS stimulants and psychotomimetics
  :subcategory: 
  :features:
    Class: Psychotomimetic (hallucinogen)
    Similar drug(s): ketamine
    Actions: Euphoria, sensory distortion, hallucinations. Schizophrenia-like psychosis.
      Like ketamine, it produces analgesia and amnesia which confers action as a dissociative
      anaesthetic.
    MOA: Blocks the ion channel of NMDA-type glutamate receptor. How this leads to
      the behavioural effects is not fully established, but effects on dopaminergic
      transmission are likely. Phencyclidine also blocks σ receptors.
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Most commonly absorbed by inhalation of smoke but also orally
      active. T0.5 10–90h
    Clinical use: Use of phencyclidine as anaesthetic now stopped, though ketamine
      is still used for this purpose (see card 21.04). Dangerous drug of abuse.

phenelzine (isocarboxazid, moclobemide) [affective disorders]:
  :card_id: '24.05'
  :name: Phenelzine
  :category: Affective disorders
  :subcategory: Major Depressive Disorder
  :features:
    Class: Monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI)
    Similar drug(s): isocarboxazid, moclobemide
    Actions: Antidepressant
    MOA: Phenelzine and isocarboxacid irreversibly inhibit both the A  B forms of
      monoamine oxidase. MAO is found in nerve endings, MAO-A acting preferentially
      on noradrenaline and 5-HT and MAO-B acting mainly on dopamine. MAO inhibition
      increases the amount of transmitter in the nerve- ending. Antidepressant action
      is due to MAO-A inhibition. Moclobemide is a selective, reversible inhibitor
      of MAO-A. (MAO-B inhibitors are used for Parkinson’s disease (see card 20.03).)
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Oral administration. Plasma half-life 1–2h, but action lasts
      much longer because of irreversible inhibition of MAO. Moclobemide T0.5 1–2h.
    Clinical use: Depression; may have particular value for atypical depression. Social
      phobia. Clinical effect takes some days to develop.
    Adverse effects: Postural hypotension. Headache. Insomnia. Sexual dysfunction.
      Dry mouth, urinary retention Convulsions with overdose. Increased risk of suicide
      in young patients. Cheese reaction with dietary tyramine – hypertensive crisis.
      Cheese reaction is less pronounced with moclobemide (since MAO-B is still functional).
    Special points: Adverse effects are more frequent than with the TCAs or SSRIs
      so MAOIs are second-line treatment for depression.
phenobarbital [antiepileptic drugs]:
  :card_id: '25.05'
  :name: Phenobarbital
  :category: Antiepileptic drugs
  :subcategory: 
  :features:
    Class: Barbiturate
    Actions: Anticonvulsant. Hypnotic (at higher doses)
    MOA: Binds to the barbiturate site on the GABAA receptor to enhance the activity
      of GABA in opening the Cl– channel. This reduces neuronal excitability and action
      potential frequency at the epileptic focus. Effects on Na+ and Ca2+ channels
      may contribute to the anticonvulsant activity.
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Oral admin. Some drug is excreted unchanged, but majority of
      drug is oxidised in liver. T0.5 50–100h
    Clinical use: Tonic-clonic and simple partial seizures, particularly in children
    Adverse effects: Highly sedative. Megaloblastic anaemia, hypersensitivity reactions.
      In overdose coma and respiratory and circulatory failure. Induces dependence.
      Drug interactions due to hepatic enzyme induction.

      output.'
    MOA: Binds covalently (and therefore irreversibly) to α receptors and blocks NA
      action, but phentolamine’s action is reversible. Plasma half-life 3h, (longer
      in the elderly). Given orally; plasma half-life ~12h; action lasts longer (up
      to several days) because of irreversible binding to receptor.
    Clinical use: Used in the treatment of phaeochromocytoma
    Adverse effects: Postural hypotension and tachycardia

    Actions: 'Parasympathomimetic actions: contracts smooth muscle (e.g. gut, bladder,
      pupil); decreases rate and force of heart beat; glandular secretion (e.g. salivary,
      sweat, gastric acid); inhibits neurotransmitter release.'
    MOA: Action in glaucoma is due to interaction with M3 receptors which couple to
      Gq to increase cellular IP3 and DAG concentrations. Constriction of pupil aids
      drainage of aqueous humour and lowers intraocular pressure. For glaucoma pilocarpine
      is given as eye drops and actions last for a day. A slow delivery system placed
      under the eyelid acts for several days.
    Clinical use: Glaucoma (narrow and wide angle). Bethanechol to stimulate bladder
      emptying or to improve gut motility.
    Adverse effects: Blurred vision (contraction of ciliary muscle). Otherwise few
      unwanted effects because of very limited systemic absorption of topically applied
      drug. Bethanechol may produce bronchoconstriction.

    Class: Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (NRI)
    Similar drug(s): maprotiline
    Actions: Antidepressant
    MOA: Inhibits selectively the reuptake of noradrenaline into noradrenergic neurons.
      (No effect on 5-HT and dopamine transmission.) The antidepressant action is
      not seen for a few weeks, indicating that other changes (e.g. down-regulation
      of receptors) are required for the clinical effects.
    Abs/Distrib/Elim: Oral administration. Metabolised in liver by cytochrome P450
      system. Plasma half-life 15h (influenced by P450 inhibitors or inducers).
    Clinical use: Depression. Panic disorder. Proposed for ADHD
    Adverse effects: Insomnia, headache, effects due to antagonism of muscarinic and
      histamine receptors, e.g. sweating, dry mouth, constipation. Unlike SSRIs does

      cells in pancreatic islets
    MOA: Similar to sulphonylureas. Interaction with the sulphonylurea receptor, a
      subunit of the KATP channel in the cell membrane of B cells, causes the K+ channel
      to close. This depolarises the cell membrane and activates voltage-dependent
      Ca2+ channels. Ca2+ entry promotes exocytosis of insulin. Quick onset and short
      duration of action. Half-life 1h. (Its actions can be reduced by drugs that
      induce hepatic P450 enzymes, e.g. carbamazepine.) Nateglinide half-life 1.5h.
    Clinical use: Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Rapid action allows good control of postprandial
      hyperglycaemia May be combined with metformin or a glitazone. Mainly metabolised
      in liver, so useful in patients with renal insufficiency. Hypoglycaemia (uncommon
      unless its metabolism is inhibited by other drugs, e.g. gemfibrozil).

  :features:
    Class: Oral hypoglycaemic agent (thiazolidinedione)
    Similar drug(s): pioglitazone
    Actions: Lowers blood glucose concentration
    MOA: 'Activates the peroxisomal proliferator – activated receptor – γ in adipose
      tissue, liver and skeletal muscle to promote transcription of genes coding for
      proteins important in insulin action. Important effects in control of blood
      glucose are: reduced glucose release from the liver, increased uptake into muscle
      and increased sensitivity (reduced resistance) to insulin. The effects develop
      over 2–3 months. Rapid oral absorption, highly bound to plasma proteins. Eliminated
      mainly by P450 metabolism in liver. (Interactions may occur with drugs inhibiting
      or inducing cytochrome P450.) Short half-life (7h) but some activity of metabolites.'
    Clinical use: Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Generally used with a sulphonylurea or
      metformin Weight gain, fluid retention (may precipitate heart failure). Risk
      of hypoglycaemia is low. Some glitazones are hepatotoxic so the group as a whole
      is avoided in patients with liver disease.

  :subcategory: 
  :features:
    Class: A nucleoside antiretroviral agent
    Similar drug(s): didanosine
    Actions: Inhibits the action of the viral reverse transcriptase of HIV viruses
    MOA: Phosphorylated by host cell enzymes to give zidovudine trisphosphate which
      interferes with viral DNA synthesis. Given orally but can be given by i.v. infusion;
      the concentration in the CSF is 65% of the blood level. The T0.5 of the false
      trisphosphate is 3h.
    Clinical use: Human immunodeficiency virus infection in combination with other
      agents. Slows progress of the disease without curing the infection.
    Adverse effects: 'With long-term use: blood dyscrasias, GIT disturbances, myopathy,
      rashes, fever and a flulike syndrome.'
    Special points: Resistance is likely to occur. To reduce this possibility, the
      drug is used in combination with other antiretrovirals.
zolpidem (zopiclone, zaleplon) [anxiolytics and hypnotics]:
  :card_id: '22.02'
  :name: Zolpidem
  :category: Anxiolytics and hypnotics
  :subcategory: 
  :features:
    Class: Non-benzodiazepine agonist at benzodiazepine receptor
    Similar drug(s): zopiclone, zaleplon
    Actions: Hypnotic (less anxiolytic, amnestic and muscle relaxant activity than
      benzodiazepines)
    MOA: 'Binds to benzodiazepine binding site on GABAA receptor (the more limited
      actions are due to selective action on BZ1 receptors) to enhance the channel
      opening activity of GABA. Reduces electrical excitability of neuronal cell membrane.
      Oral admin. Zolpidem and zopiclone are short acting (t1⁄2 2–3 and 6h respectively):
      zaleplon very short acting.'
    Clinical use: Insomnia
    Adverse effects: Well tolerated. Some drowsiness, confusion and dizziness. Tolerance
      and dependence (with withdrawal symptoms) may develop. Allergic reactions. Enhances
      CNS depression caused by other drugs (e.g. ethanol).
